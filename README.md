# 4chat/BlitzChat Plus
Peer to peer chat software. Kind of sucks. Do whatever you want with it, don't even have to attribute me for this one. 
## How to use
### Creating a Room
	1. Launch 4chat

	2. Under the "Connection" dropdown menu, select "Internet TCP/IP"

	3. Click "Ok"

	5. Click "Create new game"
### In the room
  	1. Follow on-screen instructions.

  	2. Press F1 to start typing a new message.

  	3. Press return to send it.

**NOTE**: *There might be issues with the receiving of messages while you're typing. This has yet to be solved. Maybe you, dear reader, could solve this?*
### Joining an existing room
